Remember Me
===========

This was my final project for the Ruby on Rails portion of Nashville Software School.

This is a contract management system based on groups.

The idea was instead of adding each one of your contacts individually into an app. You would simply add yourself into this app and then join groups.

These groups would allow anyone who joined said group access to anyone else who had joined the group. i.e. If Bob Smith joined a bowling league group.
Bob would then be added to everyone else who was already in the bowling league as well as Bob's address book would be populated with everyone in the league.

This app also want to have some privacy where groups would request what types of information they require to join. i.e. A bowling league would want phone number to get a hold of everyone but would not care about home address.
This would allow for users to feel safe about giving their information to the app without worry that everyone would simply be able to look at their information.
